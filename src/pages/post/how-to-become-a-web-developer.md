## Getting started

Here are some steps you can take to become a web developer as a beginner:

### 1. Understand how the web works.

As a web developer, you will be creating apps that run on the web, so you must understand everything from how the web works to how websites are served to users and everything in between.

### 2. Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

These are the fundamental building blocks of the web, and you'll need to know them if you want to create web pages and applications. You can find plenty of free resources online, such as tutorials and code examples, to help you learn.

### 3. Practice, practice, practice.

The best way to learn web development is by doing it – so don't be afraid to experiment and try out new things. You can create your simple web pages or even try building small applications to get a feel for what it's like to develop for the web.

### 4. Join online communities and forums.

Many online communities and forums are dedicated to web development, where you can connect with other developers, ask questions, and learn from their experiences. One places i'll strongly recommend is Twitter. Hundreds of developers share daily content that will help you on you journey to becoming a web developer.

### 5. Consider taking a course or attending a workshop.

These programs are often tailored to beginners and can provide you with the guidance and support you need to succeed. While you can undoubtedly learn web development on your own, taking a course or attending a workshop can help you learn faster and stay on track. You can also find lots of free tutorials on YouTube as well as paid ones on platforms like Udemy.

### 6. Keep learning and staying up-to-date.

Web development is rapidly evolving, and new technologies and techniques are constantly being introduced.

This could involve attending conferences, reading blogs and books, or taking additional courses.

## More...

In addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developers can use other programming languages for web development. Some popular languages include:

### **PHP**:

PHP is a server-side language commonly used to build dynamic web applications. It's often used in conjunction with databases, such as MySQL, to store and retrieve data.

### **NodeJs**:

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, creating web applications with server-side scripting. Node.js is often used in web development to create server-side scripts that are responsible for handling HTTP requests and generating dynamic web page content. This makes it possible to create real-time web applications that can handle large amounts of data and traffic.

### **Python:**

Python is a versatile, high-level language that developers can use for web development, data science, machine learning, and more. It's known for its simplicity and readability, making it a good choice for beginners.

### **Ruby:**

Ruby is a popular, dynamic language often used for web development thanks to its simplicity and flexibility. It's the language behind the Ruby on Rails web framework, known for its convention-over-configuration approach.

By learning these and other programming languages, you can become a well-rounded web developer and expand your skills and career opportunities.

## Conclusion

Becoming a web developer is a challenging but rewarding journey. By learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, practicing, joining online communities, taking courses, and staying up-to-date, you can become a web developer and build your web applications. And by learning additional programming languages, you can further broaden your skills and expertise.
