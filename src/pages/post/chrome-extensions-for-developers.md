Chrome extensions are handy tools that almost everyone who has a Chrome browser uses. These extensions can make it easier to perform tasks that normally require opening a new browser, performing a search, and clicking a few links and buttons.

Aside from their ease of use and convenience, most of these extensions are small in size and can perform tasks such as changing the browser's default behavior by introducing new functionality or modifying existing browser features, which developers find helpful.
